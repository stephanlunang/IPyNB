These scans are taken after the verified 30deg theta at neutral rotation was done and after adjusting the monochromator to 280 believed to be optimum.

There were some issues that appeared when doing these scans.  Sometimes the voltage on the 6131 would freeze at -120V during a scan.  I would shut down the ESCA software and re-open it and verified that i could set the power supply using the utilites and do a quick moniter of a fixed scan to see that it was behaving correctly and then run the dithered scans i wanted and it would scan correctly with proper varying voltage on the 6131.
